# CatPhotos

This repository contains the code for a simple website called "CatPhotos". I originally created this project to experiment with Bootstrap when I was first learning about CSS frameworks and libraries. As such, the code largely remains in its original state, offering a look back at my early days of web development and my initial interest in coding.

## About the Website

"CatPhotos" is a basic static website dedicated to cats. It features several pages:

- **Home:** The landing page, inviting users to view cute cat photos.
- **About Us:** Explains the website's purpose, stating it was created out of a love for cats, and notes that it's ad-supported.
- **Register or Signup:** A form for user registration.
- **Login or Sign In:** A form for user login, promising an ad-free experience.
- **Foods that Cats Love:** A list of food items cats reportedly enjoy, such as fish and milk.
- **Breakfast for the Kitty:** A simple recipe for a cat's breakfast.
- **Cats! Cats! Cats!:** A gallery of various cat images with hover effects.

The website utilizes Bootstrap for its responsive design and components, along with custom CSS for additional styling and interactive elements like image scaling on hover.
